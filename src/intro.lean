# The Euclid Game, version 1.0.0.

## Where the past and the future of mathematics meet...

# What is this game?

Welcome to The Euclid Game! In this game, you will learn the basics of **axiomatic geometry** and 
how a program called **Lean** is used to formalize some mathematical results.
What does this mean? Instead of writing down proofs in English or any other human language, we will
explain the steps of the proof to this **proof assistant** by using a precise language, similar to a
programming language in some aspects.
The advantage of doing this is that the computer can keep track of the proof for us, and tell
us if we make any steps that aren't logically valid; computers are very good at understanding logic
after all!

What makes *proof assistants* unique is the fact that they allow us to step through and
understand individual steps in a proof. A mathematician would remark that we are providing **computer-assisted proofs**. 
Later we will see how the proof assistant can do more than just follow our instructions; it can also
search for useful facts we might want to use. Lean can even complete some moderately
difficult statements on its own, using proof methods based on pre-defined rules.
This saves us time thinking about details in some situations, without losing any confidence in the
correctness of the result, and in some cases we can even learn from the proofs Lean finds!

To get started, click on the first world, the blue circle labelled "Tutorial World", on the right.
Once you complete all the levels of the Tutorial World, hit "Main Menu" in the top left corner of the screen to get back here. 
In this way, you will see that the first blue circle has turned into green, which 
will give you access to the following world.
You can use this menu to navigate as you try more of the problems.

Have fun!

The Euclid Game was created as part of the BIYSC project on "Can computers do math?" at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

Some of the explanations are taken/adapted from the original <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/"

Lean is a computer theorem prover being developed at Microsoft Research.
